# Ferox Restore Alert
Displays a warning if you're in Ferox Enclave, but haven't restored your stats.

## Configuration
A custom run energy value (defaulted to 90) can be set in the plugin configuration, at or above your energy will be considered fully restored.

Additionally, the text color, background color and default fixed position of the alert can also be set in the plugin configuration.

_**Note:**_ _The overlay, like other UI elements in RuneLite, can also be moved by holding the Alt key and dragging the overlay to the desired location whilst it is visible._
